# Evaluations

This folder contains dated security, performance, and technology evaluations. Each document records the analysis, decision, and any changes made.

## Policy

- **Every evaluation gets its own file**, named `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`.
- **Date the file** with the date the evaluation was performed.
- **Record changes made** — if the evaluation leads to code, schema, or configuration changes, note them directly in the document.
- **Categories**: security audits, performance reviews, library/technology evaluations, infrastructure decisions.
- **Do not delete old evaluations.** They serve as a decision log. If a decision is reversed, create a new dated evaluation referencing the original.
